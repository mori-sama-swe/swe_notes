# **Understanding Bit and Bytes:**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Bits:**
>
> - A **bit** (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing and can have a value of 0 or 1.
>
> **Bytes:**
>
> - A **byte** is a collection of 8 bits. This is the standard size of a byte in most modern systems.
> - A **byte** is often used to represent a single character in text (e.g., ASCII encoding).

## To Calculate Amount of Bits in a Byte

since a **bit** can only hold 2 values (0 or 1), **2 will be the base** → so if we have **4 bytes** that means there are 32 bits in 4 bytes:  
$$
2^4
$$


- because → 4 bytes → **<u>each byte is 8 bits</u>** so **<u>4 (bytes) x 8 (bits that each byte holds) = 32</u>** bits in total
- the base will be 2 because there can only be two possible values, and the exponent is X amount or the times we are multiplying the base by.
