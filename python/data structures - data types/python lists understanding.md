# Python Lists

A `list` in Python is a **way to store multiple items in a single variable.** Think of it like a to-do list: it keeps things in order, and you can add, remove, or change items whenever you want.

> [!note]

>  Lists are:

> - **Ordered**: Items have a specific sequence.
>
> - **Mutable**: You can modify them after creation.
>
> - **Flexible**: They can hold any data type—numbers, strings, even other lists

## Basic Operations and Understanding

### Creating A `list`

`iterable` : a collection of values that can be iterated over.

You create a `list` using square brackets `[]`, with items separated by commas. Here’s an example:

```python
my_list = [1,2,3,'apple']
```

- This list has integers (1, 2, 3) and strings ('apple', 'banana').

---

### Accessing Items

Each item has an index (position), starting at 0. You use the index in square brackets to grab an item:

```python
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[3])  # Output: 'apple'
```

You can also use negative indices to count from the end:

```python
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 'banana'
```

---

### Basic Operations

Here’s how you can mess with lists:

**Adding items:**

- append(): Adds an item to the end.

```python
my_list.append(4)  # Now: [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana', 4]
```

- insert(): Adds an item at a specific index:

```python
my_list.insert(1, 'orange')  # Now: [1, 'orange', 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana', 4]
```

**Removing items:**

- remove(): Deletes the first occurrence of a value.

```python
my_list.remove('apple')  # Now: [1, 'orange', 2, 3, 'banana', 4]
```

- pop(): Removes an item by index (and returns it). Without an index, it removes the last item.

```python
my_list.pop(2)  # Removes 2, now: [1, 'orange', 3, 'banana', 4]
```

**Changing items:** 

- Just assign a new value to an index:

```python
my_list[0] = 'new'  # Now: ['new', 'orange', 3, 'banana', 4]
```

## List Concatenation

> [!note]
>
> **List concatenation** in Python refers to the process of combining two or more lists into a single list. Python provides several methods to achieve this, each with its own advantages, use cases, and performance characteristics. Below, I'll outline the primary methods, their use cases, and tips for effective usage, along with performance considerations.

> [!important]
>
> ### Summary
>
> - **Simple and readable:** Use the + operator for small lists when creating a new list is fine.
> - **In-place modification:** Use extend() for efficiency when modifying an existing list.
> - **Multiple lists:** Use itertools.chain() for efficiency and flexibility, especially with large or numerous lists.
> - **Mixed elements:** Use list unpacking (*) for flexibility.
> - **Performance:** Be cautious with large lists—extend() and itertools.chain() are generally more efficient than + or unpacking.

### Ways to Concatenate Lists

#### Using the + Operator

The + operator is the simplest and most intuitive way to concatenate two lists.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = list1 + list2  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- **How it works:** It creates a new list containing all elements from both lists in the order they are combined.
- **Key feature:** The original lists (list1 and list2) remain unchanged.

---
#### Using the extend() Method

The extend() method adds all elements from one list to the end of another list, **modifying the original list.**

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.extend(list2)  # list1 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- **How it works:** It appends each element of list2 to list1 in place.

- **Key feature:** Modifies the original list (list1), while list2 remains unchanged.

----

#### Using itertools.chain() for Multiple Lists

The `itertools.chain()` function is useful for concatenating multiple lists efficiently, especially when you don’t need an immediate list result.

```python
import itertools

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list3 = [7, 8, 9]
result = list(itertools.chain(list1, list2, list3))  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

- **How it works:** Returns an iterator that yields elements from all input lists. Convert it to a list with list() if needed.

- **Key feature:** Doesn’t create intermediate lists until you explicitly convert the iterator to a list.

---

#### Using List Unpacking with `*`

The * operator can unpack lists into a new list, providing flexibility to mix lists with other elements.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = [*list1, *list2]  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

```python
result = [0, *list1, 7, *list2]  # Result: [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]
```

- **How it works:** Creates a new list by unpacking the elements of the input lists.

- **Key feature:** Allows combining lists with additional elements in a single expression.

#### Tips for Effective Concatenation

> [!important]
>
> **Performance Considerations**
>
> Time Complexity
>
> - **+ Operator:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists. It creates a new list and copies all elements, which can be slow for large lists.
> - **extend() Method:** O(m), where m is the length of the list being added. It modifies the existing list, avoiding the overhead of creating a new one.
> - **itertools.chain():** O(1) for creating the iterator, O(n + m + ...) to convert to a list, where the total length depends on all input lists. Efficient for multiple lists since it avoids intermediate copies.
> - **List Unpacking (\*):** Similar to +, with O(n + m) complexity, as it creates a new list.
>
> Memory Efficiency
>
> - **+ Operator and List Unpacking:** Creates a new list, doubling memory usage temporarily if the original lists are retained.
> - **extend():** More memory-efficient because it modifies the existing list in place, leveraging Python’s dynamic array over-allocation (extra space for future elements).
> - **itertools.chain():** Most memory-efficient if you use the iterator directly, as it avoids creating a new list until necessary.
>
> Large Lists and Multiple Concatenations:
>
> - Using + in a loop (e.g., result = result + list_i) is inefficient because it creates a new list each time, leading to O(n²) complexity for n elements across iterations.
> - For multiple lists, prefer:
>   - A loop with extend(): Builds the result incrementally with O(n) total complexity.
>   - itertools.chain(): Handles multiple lists efficiently without intermediate copies.

> [!important]
>
> **Tips:**
>
> 1. Preserve Original Lists:
>    - Use + or list unpacking if you need to keep the original lists intact.
>    - Example: new_list = list1 + list2 instead of modifying list1.
> 2. Minimize Memory Usage:
>    - Use extend() when you’re building a list and don’t need a separate copy.
>    - Example: master_list.extend(new_items).
> 3. Handle Multiple Lists Efficiently:
>    - Avoid chaining + operators (e.g., list1 + list2 + list3), as it creates multiple intermediate lists.
>    - Use itertools.chain() or a loop with extend() instead.
> 4. **Work with Iterators:**
>    - If you don’t need a list immediately, use itertools.chain() as an iterator to save memory, especially with large datasets.
> 5. **Flexibility with Unpacking:**
>    - Use * unpacking for readable, one-line concatenations with mixed elements.
>    - Example: result = [*prefix, *data, *suffix].
> 6. **Avoid sum() for Lists:**
>    - While sum([[1, 2], [3, 4]], []) technically works, it’s slow (O(n²) for large lists) and meant for numbers, not lists.

## List Memberships 

> [!note]
>
> In Python, the `"in"` and `"not in"` operators are used to test membership in lists, which are ordered collections of items.
>
> **These operators allow you to check whether a specific element is present or absent in a list.** Given the query "lists not in, in memberships," it seems to ask about how these operators work with lists, likely focusing on membership testing

### Basic Usage of "in" and "not in"

- The "in" operator checks if an element exists in a list and returns True if it does, False otherwise.

- The "not in" operator checks if an element does not exist in a list and returns True if it is absent, False otherwise.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Using "in"
print(3 in my_list)    # Output: True
print(5 in my_list)    # Output: False

# Using "not in"
print(5 not in my_list)  # Output: True
print(2 not in my_list)  # Output: False
```

### Membership with Lists Inside Lists

If a list contains other lists (nested lists), "in" checks whether a specific sublist is an element of the outer list.'

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

print([3, 4] in list_of_lists)  # Output: True
print([3, 5] in list_of_lists)  # Output: False
```

> [!note]
>
> Here, [3, 4] is an exact match for an element in list_of_lists, so it returns True. However, [3, 5] is not an element, so it returns False. Note that "in" does not check for partial matches or subsets unless the exact object is present.

### Filtering Lists with "in" and "not in"

You can use these operators in **list comprehensions to filter elements based on membership in another list.**

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# Elements in list1 that are in list2
common = [x for x in list1 if x in list2]
print(common)  # Output: [3, 4, 5]

# Elements in list1 that are not in list2
unique = [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]
print(unique)  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Checking Subset-Like Relationships

> [!note]
>
> **If you want to check whether all elements of one list are in another list (similar to a subset), "in" alone won’t suffice because it checks for the entire list as an element.** Instead, use the all() function with a generator expression.

```python
list1 = [3, 4]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Check if all elements of list1 are in list2
is_subset = all(x in list2 for x in list1)
print(is_subset)  # Output: True

# Check if any element of list1 is not in list2
has_exclusion = any(x not in list2 for x in list1)
print(has_exclusion)  # Output: False
```

## List Traversals

> [!note]
>
> List traversals in Python refer to the process of systematically iterating through the elements of a list to access, process, or manipulate each item.

> [!note]
>
> Python offers a variety of ways to traverse lists, and the best method depends on your specific needs:
>
> - Use a for loop for simplicity.
> - Opt for a while loop when you need more control.
> - Choose list comprehensions for creating transformed lists.
> - Use enumerate() when you need indices.
> - Consider recursion for nested structures.
> - Leverage iterators for advanced or custom traversal.
>
> Each approach is powerful in its own right, making Python a flexible language for list traversal tasks!

### Using a For Loop

The `for` loop is the simplest and most commonly used method to traverse a list in Python. It allows you to directly access each element in the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

### Using a While Loop

A `while` loop can be used to traverse a list by maintaining an index variable to access elements sequentially.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
index = 0
while index < len(my_list):
    print(my_list[index])
    index += 1
```

### Using List Comprehensions

List comprehensions offer a concise way to traverse a list and create a new list by applying an operation to each element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = [item ** 2 for item in my_list]
print(squared_list)

#Output:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Using the `enumerate()` Function

The enumerate() function allows you to traverse a list while simultaneously accessing both the index and value of each element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for index, item in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"Index {index}: {item}")
    
#output:
Index 0: 1
Index 1: 2
Index 2: 3
Index 3: 4
Index 4: 5
```

### Using Recursion

Recursion involves defining a function that processes the first element of the list and then calls itself on the remaining elements.

```python
def traverse_list(lst):
    if not lst:  # Base case: empty list
        return
    print(lst[0])  # Process first element
    traverse_list(lst[1:])  # Recursive call on rest of the list

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
traverse_list(my_list)
```

## Index, Sort and Reverse

> [!note]
>
> In Python, lists are a versatile data structure used to store ordered collections of items. Three fundamental operations for working with lists are indexing, sorting, and reversing. Below, I’ll explain each operation, how it works, and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

### Sorting Lists

Sorting rearranges the elements of a list into a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Python offers two main tools: the sort() method and the sorted() function.

**Key Details:**

`sort()` method: modifies the original list in place

- Default: Ascending order.
- Use reverse=True for descending order.
- Requires all elements to be comparable (e.g., all numbers or all strings).

`sorted()` function: returns a new sorted list, leaving the original unchanged.

- Also supports reverse=True for descending order.

```python
# using sort()
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
numbers.sort()                # Ascending order
print(numbers)                # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)    # Descending order
print(numbers)                # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
```

```python
# using sorted()
]original = [3, 1, 4]
sorted_list = sorted(original)
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
print(original)     # Output: [3, 1, 4] (unchanged)
```

## List Comprehensions

> [!note]
>
> **Python list comprehensions provide a concise way to create and manipulate lists. They follow a compact syntax that combines loops and conditionals to generate lists in a single line.** 
>
> Below, I’ll explain how to create lists using list comprehensions, how to manipulate them, and provide examples to illustrate their use.

## Basic Syntax of List Comprehensions

A list comprehension has the following structure:

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- **expression**: The operation or value to include in the new list.

- **item**: The variable representing each element in the iterable.

- **iterable**: A sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, range) to iterate over.

- **condition** (optional): A filter to include only certain items.

----

This is equivalent to a traditional for-loop like:

```python
new_list = []
for item in iterable:
    if condition:
        new_list.append(expression)
```
