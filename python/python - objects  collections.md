## Accessing Objects or Collections

> [!important]
>
> ##### Subscripting
>
> **Subscripting** is how you access elements in sequences or collections like lists, tuples, dictionaries, or strings. For example, my_list[0] retrieves the first item in a list. However, not all objects allow this operation.
>
> **Square Brackets [] (Subscripting)**
>
> You use square brackets [] to **access elements in a collection** or a sequence. These collections are things like:
>
> - **Lists**: my_list[0] gets the first element.
> - **Tuples**: my_tuple[1] gets the second element.
> - **Dictionaries**: my_dict["key"] gets the value associated with "key".
> - **Strings**: my_string[2] gets the third character.
>
> The term "element" is commonly used for items in a sequence (like a list or tuple), while "key-value pair" is more specific to dictionaries. In general, when you use [], you’re subscripting to access something inside a container-like object based on an index or key.

> ##### Dot Notation
>
> You use dot notation (.) to **access attributes or methods of an object**. These aren’t necessarily "elements" in the collection sense but rather properties or behaviors defined for that object. The term here is **attribute**, not "element":
>
> - **Attributes**: Variables or data belonging to an object (e.g., my_object.name).
> - **Methods**: Functions defined for an object (e.g., my_list.append(5)).
